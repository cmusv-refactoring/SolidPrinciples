### SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob") to guide developers in building systems that are easy to scale and refactor.

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
   A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**  
   Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
   Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should behave in a way that does not break the expectations set by their parent class.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It's better to have many small, specific interfaces than one large, general-purpose interface.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.

By following the SOLID principles, developers can create more modular and robust software that is easier to test, maintain, and extend.
